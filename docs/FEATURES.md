This file documents all of the features of this project.

## Fire

- When attempting to put out fire with your hands, you will be set on fire instead.
- Entities on fire do not extinguish naturally.
- Entities that are on fire will spread fire to blocks around them.
- Hitting a mob that is on fire will spread the fire to you, and vice versa.

## Fire Protection

- Fire protection now protects even better against fire damage. Full fire protection makes you completely immune to fire.
- Fire protection will sometimes prevent durability loss from fire, with full fire protection preventing all durability loss.

## Flint and Steel

- Right-clicking entities with a flint and steel now sets them on fire, this will anger the entity, so be careful!

## Creepers

- If a creeper is on fire, it will ignite!

## Slimes

- If a slime splits while burning, the resulting smaller slimes will also be on fire.

## Non-Flammable Mobs

- Some mobs, such as iron golems, are now immune to fire!

## Projectiles

- Projectiles will now carry the fire of their shooter.
