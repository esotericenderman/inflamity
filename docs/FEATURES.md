# Features

This file documents all of the features of this project.

## Fire

- When attempting to put out fire with your hands, you will be set on fire instead.
- Entities on fire do not extinguish naturally.
- Entities that are on fire will spread fire to blocks around them.
- Hitting a mob that is on fire will spread the fire to you, and vice versa.

## Fire Protection

- Fire protection now protects even better against fire damage. Full fire protection makes you completely immune to fire.
- Fire protection will sometimes prevent durability loss from fire, with full fire protection preventing all durability loss.
- Fire protection will reduce even further the time that an entity is on fire, again scaling with the fire protection level.

## Flint and Steel

- Right-clicking entities with a flint and steel now sets them on fire.
