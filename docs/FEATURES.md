This file documents all of the features of this project.

## Fire

- When attempting to put out fire with your hands, you will be set on fire instead.
- Entities on fire do not extinguish naturally.
- Entities that are on fire will spread fire to blocks around them.
- Hitting a mob that is on fire will spread the fire to you, and vice versa.

## Flint and Steel

- Right-clicking entities with a flint and steel now sets them on fire.
