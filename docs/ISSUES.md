## Will Fix

- Placed fire appears as if it's on a block when it appears on leaves and other surfaces.
- Fire charges are consumed even when no fire starts, but flint and steels don't take durability.
- Fire charges cannot be thrown in the offhand.
- Fire charges can be thrown in the main hand and at the same time another item can be used in the offhand.
