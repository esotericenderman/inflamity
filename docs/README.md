A Minecraft plugin that updates the way fire works and makes it much more powerful.

## Why?

A little-noticed fact about Minecraft fire is that it is much weaker than its real-life counterpart.

Minecraft fire goes out naturally after some time, even if there wasn't much of a reason for that to happen.

Standing on highly-flammable blocks such as  logs, coal blocks, or even TNT would surely spell doom for the whole building you're in, right? Nope - fire doesn't spread from an entity to a block, only the other way around.

This plugin aims to fix these discrepancies and give fire the power it deserves. The result is that fire becomes more akin to a natural disaster that is not to be messed with - a force of nature that is difficult to survive, let alone contain.
