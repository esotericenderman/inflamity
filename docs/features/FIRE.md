# Fire

- When attempting to put out fire with your hands, you will be set on fire instead.
- Entities on fire do not extinguish naturally.
- Entities that are on fire will spread fire to blocks around them.
- Hitting a mob that is on fire will spread the fire to you, and vice versa.
- Some entities, such as snowballs, will instantly be removed when entering fire.
- Fire does not spread anywhere, unless it makes sense for it to be there (some sort of flammable block nearby).
