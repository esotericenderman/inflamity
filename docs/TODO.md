# Ideas

## To-Do

### Additions

- Entities should be set on fire when interacted with a fire-setting item.
- Blocks should be set on fire when interacted with a fire-setting item.
- Campfires should be set on fire when interacted with a fire-setting item.
- Furnaces should be fueled when interacted with a fire-setting item.

- Add fire aspect swords to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add fire charges to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add flame bows to the list of fire-settings items.

- Allow mobs to spread fire to each other by physical contact.
- Allow mobs to spread fire to each other by hitting each other.

- If an entity hits another entity wearing thorns armour with a fire-setting item, both entities are set on fire.

- If a player is on fire, "flammable items" in their inventory will burn up.

### Changes

- Make sure entities acknowledge when a player sets them on fire.
- Make lava a LOT stronger.
- If a horse is set on fire, then so should the rider.
- Stop fire from even existing on non-flammable blocks.
- Prevent fire spread through hitting if the item that you hit with was non-flammable (such as a diamond sword).
- Make it so that some items are immune to burning in fire and lava.

### Removals
