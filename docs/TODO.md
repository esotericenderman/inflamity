## Future

### To-Do

#### Additions

- Add fire aspect swords to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add fire charges to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add flame bows to the list of fire-settings items.
- Throwable fireballs.
- Craftable ghast fireballs.
- Allow mobs to spread fire to each other by physical contact.
- If an entity hits another entity wearing thorns armour with a fire-setting item, both entities are set on fire.
- If a player is on fire, "flammable items" in their inventory will burn up.

#### Changes

- Make sure entities acknowledge when a player sets them on fire. (but smarter) - also make iron golems attack players who burn down the village.
- Make lava a LOT stronger.
- Prevent fire spread through hitting if the item that you hit with was non-flammable (such as a diamond sword).
- Make it so that some items are immune to burning in fire and lava.

### Considered

#### Additions

- Make splash potions that explode in fire have their effect amplified.
- Furnaces should be fueled when interacted with a fire-setting item.

#### Changes

- Make it so that you *can* put out fire with your hand if you are holding some items.

## 0.4.0

### Changes

- If a horse is set on fire, then so should the rider.
