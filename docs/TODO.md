### To-Do

## Future

### To-Do

#### Additions

- Add fire aspect swords to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add fire charges to the list of fire-setting items.
- Add flame bows to the list of fire-settings items.
- Craftable ghast fireballs.
- Allow mobs to spread fire to each other by physical contact.

#### Changes

- Make sure entities acknowledge when a player sets them on fire. (but smarter) - also make iron golems attack players who burn down the village.
- Make it so that some items are immune to burning in fire and lava.
- If an entity hits another entity wearing thorns armour with a fire-setting item, both entities are set on fire.
- Make fire charges and fireballs "go out" when in rain and especially when in water.

### Considered

#### Additions

- Make splash potions that explode in fire have their effect amplified.
- Furnaces should be fueled when interacted with a fire-setting item.
- If a creeper is on fire when it explodes, the explosion sets fire everywhere.
- Make magma blocks somehow set fire.

#### Changes

- Make it so that you *can* put out fire with your hand if you are holding some items.
- Make it so that lava burns items in your inventory, and not just flammable ones.
- Prevent fire from randomly going out.
